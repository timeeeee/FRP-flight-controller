EECS_582: Computer Science Senior Design 
Flight Systems
Tim Clark and Angie Wright
April 1st, 2015

** April 29th
1. k_function - needs built to reflect dynamic kalman filter
		-- currently using pre-calculated fixed kalman gain matrix
				(based on trim)
2. navigationObserver
3. unit testing
4. verification of output comparison (graph for quad chart)
5. timing tests and comparison (graphs for quad chart)
		-- need extreme minimum possible for Gonzalo's (operates at 20 htz fixed)
6. flight gear?? (for demo)
7. tk1 (for demo in plane) 
8. true system in tk1 with use serial port to file append emulator and run both programs at the same time?

9. blog -- A. current state of non-linear control logic limits
							places to improve speed and performance - kalman filter
																											- ann
																											- controller
					 B. break out of our project is the kalman filter piece of this experiment 
					 
					 C. model to code mapping

					 D. future is 	1. ann, 
													2. controller
													3. true embedded domain for serial i/o to the system for instrument sampling
													(vs using serial emulator and file append - slow)
									(use this in quad chart and blog)
					 
					 E. peron-hour estimation - lessons learned - projection of future work
					 

					
					
		


** april 6:
1. bug - line 151 - each iteration is reducting the final output by two if the commented out function is in place.
2. f_function - need to use common equations to build up this function (like h_function)
		--use the version in Aircraft_4 folder
3. k_function - needs built (like h_function)
		--use the version in Aircraft_4 folder
4. navigationObserver

flight_test_data (folder)
  contents: flight1_Oct10_2014.csv flight2_Oct10_2014.csv flight_data_dec.csv
  purpose:	historical flight data
  status:		not being used 
	
angies_older (folder)
purpose: legacy

aircraft_4 (folder)
purpose: the files from simulink/matlab that we are re-coding
status: up to date

input.csv
purpose: trimmed and formatted flight data file 
status:  in-use -- needs replaced with generated data file for this aircraft

makefile
  purpose: compile project to single binary executable
  status: functional
	
common_equations.hs
  purpose: 	old function definition file
  status:		being used as reference

constants.hs
  purpose:	constant values used by state observer and nav observer
  status:		needs trimmed to only values used in this application

main.hs
  purpose: file i/o for current value readings and passing of previous values (t-1)
  status:  complete

matrix_ops.hs
	purpose: new module to extract operations being used in state_estimation.hs
	status:  needs rebuilt or restored from previous... I messed up and deleted contents-AW
	
state_estimation.hs
  purpose: run state observer and navigation observer
  status:		active in development right now

output.txt
  purpose: output the results of running the program
  status:	working
  
results.txt, output.txt
  purpose:
  status: just for checking results- in gitignore
